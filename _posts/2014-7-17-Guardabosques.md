[Caro Silvero](http://caro-silvero.tumblr.com) and [Juan Elizalde](http://www.automne.com.ar) from Argentinian design collective [Guardabosques](http://cargocollective.com/guardabosques) created these lovely [paper sculptures](http://cargocollective.com/guardabosques/mamiferos) of wildlife, brought to life with photography on coloured backgrounds. I love the sense of personality they've managed to convey with minimal forms, and the sense of solidity and life with such delicate sculptures.
