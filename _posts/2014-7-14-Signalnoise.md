Graphic artist [James White](http://blog.signalnoise.com) (a.k.a. Signalnoise) recently released this series of 80s-inspired prints reminiscent of the airbrush artists of yore. It features a lush, neon colour palette, and its rich imagery complete with shades, palm trees and fast cars evokes times past while still appearing fresh and modern. This kind of 80s imagery with a contemporary twist is enjoying something of a renaissance right now - see also [Drew Turner](http://www.drewturner.co.uk), [Kris Tate](http://cargocollective.com/kristate) and [Leif Podhajsky](http://leifpodhajsky.com). I love the combination of the retro and the futuristic (if you haven't seen the film [Brazil](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088846/), that perfectly encapsulates it) and much of James White's [impressive portfolio](http://cargocollective.com/signalnoise)impressive portfolio is infused with the same qualities, taking inspiration from sci-fi and movies.
