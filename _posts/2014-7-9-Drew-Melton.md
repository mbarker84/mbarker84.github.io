![Drew Melton Typography](/img/drewmelton.jpg)
Welcome to Before Breakfast! Aiming to regularly share my favourite things on the web with the wider world. The very first dose of inspiration is [Drew Melton](http://yourjustlucky.com), an LA-based designer specialising in hand lettering and font creation. I came across his site featuring some visually stunning scripty fonts yesterday courtesy of [Media Temple](http://mediatemple.net)'s [Jon Setzen](http://jonsetzen.com). Visit and enjoy!
