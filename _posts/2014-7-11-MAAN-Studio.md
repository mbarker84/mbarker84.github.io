![MAAN Studio: World Cup Stamps](/img/MAAN.jpg)
Portugese design studio [MAAN](http://maandesign.com) came up with this set of commemorative [World Cup stamps](http://maandesign.com/worldcup) as a self-initiated project, taking inspiration from the rhythm of play and using geometric shapes, patterns and flags of the participating nations to create bold, striking compositions. The rest of their work is pretty darn awesome too, and well worth checking out.
