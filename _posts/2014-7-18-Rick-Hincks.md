Manchester freelance designer [Rick Hincks](http://www.rincks.co.uk) has produced this striking, [minimal series of prints](http://shop.rincks.co.uk) illustrating the significant moments of the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. The perfect adornment to the wall of any football fan! I love the simple clarity: The consistent format, team colours and line drawings illustrating the movement of the ball without the clutter ofÂ the pitch (no figures are included) make for a bold visual style and each print uniform, yet distinctive.
